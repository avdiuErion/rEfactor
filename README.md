# rE-Factor
An e-learning appliaction on refactoring techniques.

# Overview

With rE-factor, through a simple user interface and experience, the user is offered the chance of choosing an integrated refactoring technique in the system, for a deeper analysis. Learnings offered in the system are a combination of saved text in the system with the functionality of being redirected to an online website that offers detailed material on refactoring techniques.
In addition to this, the application offers the chance to apply refactoring to a user’s code with any of the integrated refactoring techniques. This means, that knowledge gained on a specific refactoring technique in the system, can also be tested in the system by the user. This is done through an interface that allows the user to put a piece of code, ask for refactoring and the system returns the refactored code.
The application is built using Microsoft’s .NET Core, based on the MVC (model-view-controller) architecture. Roslyn, Microsoft’s compiling framework for .NET, that allows for code inspection and diagnostics through API’s it makes available, is used for the refactorings.
